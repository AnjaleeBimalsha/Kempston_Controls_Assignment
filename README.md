# Kempston_Controls_Assignment
In response to the assignment provided by Kempston Controls as a part of the interview process, I've completed a comprehensive analysis and visualization task. 
The assignment comprises two main files: 
1) "KC_report.pbix"
2) "Sales_data.ipynb"

The "KC_report.pbix" utilizes the dataset "SuperStoreUS-2015.xlsx". The Power BI visualization tool is used to facilitate data transformation and create an insightful sales dashboard.
In "Sales_data.ipynb," I have processed the dataset "salesdata.csv" supplied by Kempston Controls. By using prominent Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I've conducted data loading, cleaning, and visualization procedures.
Furthermore, I have included an additional file named "KC_report.pdf," which serves as a convenient format for the "KC_report.pbix."
